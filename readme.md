# ðŸ§  Solana Pump.fun Trading Bot

An automated **high-frequency trading bot** designed for **Solana**, specifically targeting **Pump.fun tokens**.  
The bot connects to a real-time **gRPC feed** (such as [Helius](https://www.helius.xyz/), [SVS](https://www.solanavibestation.com/), or [Shyft](https://shyft.to/dashboard/pricing)) to subscribe to transaction and block events.  
It performs automatic token trades, routes events through dedicated workers, and handles real-time strategy execution.

## ðŸš¨ Requirements

> **Important: This bot requires a paid gRPC feed** to operate.

To run this bot, you must have access to a **Yellowstone-compatible gRPC streaming provider**, such as:

- [Helius](https://www.helius.xyz/)
- [SVS](https://www.solanavibestation.com/)
- [Shyft](https://shyft.to/dashboard/pricing)

These services provide real-time access to:

- All Solana transaction data
- Pump.fun trading events
- Your own wallet activity

You must configure your **gRPC endpoint and API key** via environment variables (see below).
